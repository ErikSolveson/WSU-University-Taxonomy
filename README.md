# Washington State University Taxonomy

This repository provides the WordPress plugin used to manage Washington State University central taxonomies. Data populated by this plugin in WordPress is also available in the repository's `data/` directory to aid in populating other systems.

## Taxonomies

### University Categories

University Categories are used to classify information throughout the university into general topics. These topics were specifically created to not track the academic or research structure provided by the university. Rather, they should be thought of as general topics that would survive organizational changes.

### University Locations

University Locations are used to assign topical locations to information generated by the university. These are physical locations where Washington State University has a presence.

### University Organizations

University Organizations are used to assign physical and logical structure to groups inside the University. These are likely to be the most fluid as offices, departments, and colleges change over the years.
